# Blinking_game
Spark AR studio project
Spark AR Studio project this about a game which is based on eye blinking in Spark AR Studio. In Spark AR Studio we can create many projects like 3d animated poster, colour portriat, object reveal, 3d stickers lots and lots to use, it is user friendly and no need of experience to get started. Spark AR Studio also has inbuilt assests which easy to use different effects.
In this blinking project i have used some assests like illustration,in spark ar i have set my camera and then i placed everything like background and character and objects then with the help of transformation i postioned everything. then with the help of text i gave new score and game over, then with the help of patch editor i used some nodes to give animation to my background, character and objects, when i blink the character will be jumping and while character passes the object the score will be incresed and when i dash the object the game will be over, and finally i gave background musics for the blinking game with the help of nodes.
